                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am not a morning person, and I tend to focus better at evenings. While I am doing this work, it is 4AM. I sleep in until 12PM, and then is when my daily routines begin. I love exercising, and I go jogging almost every other day. I feel healthy when
                    I run and I love the feeling. Like my area of study, I love being around the computer and playing a lot of games. I enjoy playing all sorts of steam games. During school, I try to stay away from them because I can easily get occupied
                    with them. Also, schoolwork is overwhelming and I get very loaded with all the assignments. I am a type of person that can't go past anything with fully understanding the concepts, and it keeps me very busy.

                <h2>Studying</h2>
                <p>
                    Learning a new language is always a challenge for me and I really enjoy it. Programming languages were like that at first to me. It was very hard when first starting it, and got better as I got used to the concept of it. I think that one of my high interests
                    is learning and making use of the programming languages. Recently, I was trying to make a program to buy tickets, and I was so interested in it, I spent almost a week trying to make tht program work.

                <h2>My recent interests</h2>
                <p>
                    Because there is just one week left for this semester, my focus is mostly on the finals. Then, I am also looking forward to next semester that is starting in less than a month left. I am also looking forward to starting co-op soon. Also I have a vacation
                    plan in the middle of November, and I have to plan my schoolwork around that. This is concerning, but at the same time, I hope this refreshes me before the co-op begins.
